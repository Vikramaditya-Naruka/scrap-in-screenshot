This project automates the process of extracting data from screenshots and saving the extracted information into PDF files. The tool is particularly useful for handling tabular data or specific information captured in screenshots, converting it into a structured format for easier analysis or reporting. It involves image processing, text recognition (likely using OCR), and organizing the extracted data into a readable format before saving it as a PDF.
